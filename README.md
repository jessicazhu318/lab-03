## Lab Question Answers

### Introduction
 Answer to Question 1: 
   RESTful APIs are scalable since the REST architecture means that the APIs
   are stateless, so no client request information needs to be retained by
   the server, which reduces the load on the server and makes it possible for
   the server to simultaneously handle a big number of clients. Also, with
   the REST architecture, caching is supported, which reduces some of the
   interactions needed between the client and server as well as improves the
   response time of the server.
